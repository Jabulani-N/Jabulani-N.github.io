Interested in seeing how I made it?


This website's frontend source code is [right here](https://github.com/Jabulani-N/Jabulani-N.github.io/blob/main/index.html)

I have a repository with my first HTML project [right here](https://github.com/Jabulani-N/holbertonschool-web_front_end/tree/main/html_advanced), which can demonstrate the basics of creating this.
