# [Visit My Website](https://jabulani-n.github.io)

This is an HTML project that serves as a digital resume, and repository of my proudest projects. A believer in *not* reinventing the wheel, I created it by adapting a multi-purpose template distributed by [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/) and integrated my own html techniques.

## Index.html

`index.html` holds the the main page itself. all the text you'll find [when you visit](https://jabulani-n.github.io) is housed within.


## Assets

The `assets` directory holds and hosts any images or files I use in the website, and [modifications to default HTML](./assets/css/style.css). They don't "need" to go here, but it is very helpful to keep things organized with everything in its place.
